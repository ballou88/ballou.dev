Hi, I'm Mike.

I’m a software engineer with 16 years of experience, including the last 7 in leadership roles. Over the course of my career, I’ve worked across a variety of disciplines, starting as a QA engineer before moving into full-stack development (PHP, Rails, Node.js), data engineering, and most recently specializing as a backend engineer.

If your interested in learning more about my work history have a look at my [[Resume]]

This website is a space for me to publicly track my projects and hold myself accountable for how I spend my time. I’ll occasionally share insights about the tools I use, tech that interests me, projects I’m working on, and various other topics that catch my attention.
